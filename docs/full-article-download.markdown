=====================

For feeds that accept only a summary, it's possible to download the full content directly from the original website.

How the content grabber works?
------------------------------

1. Try with rules first (xpath patterns) for the domain name (see `PicoFeed\Rules\`)
2. Try to find the text content by using common attributes for class and id
3. Finally, if nothing is found, the feed content is displayed

The content downloader use a fake user agent, actually Google Chrome under Mac Os X.

However the content grabber doesn't work very well with all websites.

**The best results are obtained with Xpath rules file.**


How to write a grabber rules file?
----------------------------------

Add a PHP file to the directory `PicoFeed\Rules`, the filename must be the domain name:

Example with the BBC website, `www.bbc.co.uk.php`:

```php
<?php

return array(
    'test_url' => 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23911833',
    'body' => array(
        '//div[@class="story-body"]',
    ),
    'strip' => array(
        '//script',
        '//form',
        '//style',
        '//*[@class="story-date"]',
        '//*[@class="story-header"]',
        '//*[@class="story-related"]',
        '//*[contains(@class, "byline")]',
        '//*[contains(@class, "story-feature")]',
        '//*[@id="video-carousel-container"]',
        '//*[@id="also-related-links"]',
        '//*[contains(@class, "share") or contains(@class, "hidden") or contains(@class, "hyper")]',
    )
);
```

Actually, only `body`, `strip` and `test_url` are supported.
