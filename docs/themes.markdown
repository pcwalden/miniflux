How to create a theme for Miniflux?
-----------------------------------

It's very easy to write a custom theme for Miniflux.

A theme is just a CSS file, images and fonts.
A theme doesn't change the behaviour of the application but only the page layout.

The first step is to create a new directory structure for your theme:

```bash
mkdir -p themes/mysuperskin/{css,img,fonts}
```

The name of your theme should be only alphanumeric.

There is the following directories inside your theme:

- `css`: Your stylesheet, the file must be named `app.css` (required)
- `img`: Theme images (not required)
- `fonts`: Theme fonts (not required)

Miniflux use responsive design, so it's better if your theme can handle mobile devices.
